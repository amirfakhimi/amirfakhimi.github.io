        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-1"> An FPV Drone Radio Transmitter is an electronic device that uses radio signals to transmit commands wirelessly via a set radio frequency over to the Radio Receiver, which is connected to an aircraft or multirotor being remotely controlled. In other words, it’s the device that translates pilot’s commands into movement of the multirotor.In some radios there is an option to connect an external transmitter module. This &nbsp;makes it possible to use a different frequency (for instance, 900MHz in a 2.4GHz radio) or a different receiver from another brand/protocol (Crossfire CRSF module with Crossfire V2 Micro Receiver in FrSky Taranis).</p>

        <h3 class="u-text u-text-1"> Channels </h3>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> A&nbsp;FPV Drone Radio Transmitter transmits commands via channels. Each channel is an individual action being sent to the aircraft.Throttle, Yaw, Pitch and Roll are the four main inputs required to control the quad. Each of them &nbsp;uses one channel, so there is minimum of four channels required. Every switch, slider or &nbsp;knob on the transmitter &nbsp;uses one channel to send the information through to the receiver.The following is an example of the typical channel setup for FPV Racing: a switch for arming the aircraft, a switch for turning on the buzzer and a switch used to select different flight modes. For this reason, it is advised to have a 6 channel radio.Basic 4-6 channel radios are usually the cheapest. Radios with more than 6 channels are typically more expensive.</p>

These gimbals are also more precise.

In general, sticks are approximately 25-27mm in length. They can be adjusted to suit personal preferences.Below is an example of the different types of stick ends:</p>

Equipment operating on those frequencies used crystals to bind the Transmitter with a Receiver. Apart from a few RC toys still available on the market, they are rarely used.2.4GHz is most popular frequency. It is a newer technology and it offers “frequency hopping” which does the job of managing multiple users frequency transmitting at the same time. This id done by scanning the frequency band and finding the best available channel during the transmission. 2.4GHz antennas are very compact as well. Generally speaking the lower the frequency, the larger the antenna. For that reason, 2.4GHz quickly became the “go to” frequency.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> A Radio Transmitter will only communicate with a Radio Receiver if the two are binded. This process might differ on specific receivers and radios. Usually, this can be done by starting the bind process on the Radio and pressing BIND button on the receiver. The best would be to refer to the user manual of your specific Rx and Tx combo.It’s important to note that a single Radio Transmitter can be bound to multiple different Receivers. At the same time, a single receiver can only be bound to a single transmitter, not multiple transmitters.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Receiver antennas are usually soldered directly to the receiver main board or attached by U.FL connectors. Antennas are made from a coax cable where the main wire is separated from “ground”. Radio Receivers are usually manufactured with two antennas to ensure the best reception.<br>
          <br>The main wire is the antenna active element which receives radio signals via a specific frequency. Length of the active element depends on the frequency and is exactly 1/4th of the wavelength for a specific frequency. Length of the antenna wire is not fixed; only active elements has to be at specific length. As am example, the wavelength for 2.4GHz transmission is 122mm. 1/4th of that equates to 30.5mm for the active element.Receivers usually come with two antennas for 2.4GHz Frequency. To achieve the best signal reception it is recommended to keep them at a 90degree angle in relation to each other when installed on the multi rotor.
